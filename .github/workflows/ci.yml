  # Integration tests require a full Dokku environment with Docker-in-Docker
  # which is unreliable in GitHub Actions. Run these locally:
  #   - vagrant up && npm run test:integration
  #   - docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up && npm run test:integration
  #
  # To run integration tests in CI, a self-hosted runner with proper Docker
  # setup would be needed.
